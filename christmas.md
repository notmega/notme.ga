feliz navidad



that's about it, thanks for watching.







~~I feel like I messed up, but I didn't, I'm heartbroken (I guess?) but it was bound to happen because it's happened every single time, since the beginning of time.  I don't need your pity, I don't need anything I can handle this by myself.  I just want someone to love, but it's fine, I'll survive, besides.  I've already survived this long.  I really truley did feel emotions for her, but they were cut short.  If anyone is reading this, don't worry about me, I'm fine, worry about someone who actually needs to be worried about.  I'll get through this,  Hasta manana.~~
